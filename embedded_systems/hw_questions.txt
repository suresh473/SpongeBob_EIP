What is GPIO? 
	GPIO pin is a versatile pin on an IC that can be configured by software to act as either an input or an output, allowing interaction with external
	devices and circuits. If configured as input, GPIO pin can read the state of a connected switch or sensor. When configured as an output, a GPIO pin can send a signal to control a connected device.

What is GPIO expander?
	GPIO expanders essentially act as a bridge, allowing a microcontroller to control or read signals from a larger number of external devices than its native GPIO pins allow. They typically communicate with the microcontroller via a serial interface like I2C or SPI, using a few pins to control a larger number of GPIOs on the expander chip.

Pull-up resistor:
	A "pull-up resistor" is a resistor used in electronic circuits to ensure a specific voltage level (typically a high logic state) on a pin or wire when no other active signal is present, usually by connecting it to the positive power supply, effectively "pulling" the voltage up to a known value; commonly used with switches and buttons to define a clear input state when the switch is open

pull-down resistor:
	A "pull-down resistor" is a resistor in an electronic circuit that is connected between a circuit pin and ground, which actively pulls the voltage on that pin to a low logic level (close to 0 volts) when no other active component is connected to it, essentially ensuring a defined state for the signal even when a switch is open.

APIC(Application peripheral interrupt controller): 
	An application peripheral interrupt controller (APIC) is a dedicated hardware component within a system that manages interrupt requests from various peripheral devices, allowing the central processing unit (CPU) to be notified efficiently when a peripheral needs attention, thus enabling timely response to events like data ready, errors, or device status changes, all while prioritizing interrupts based on their importance and configuration settings; essentially acting as a mediator between peripherals and the CPU to handle interrupt requests in an organized manner.

- MMU:
	It's a hardware component(The MMU is usually integrated into the processor, but in some systems it's a separate integrated circuit ) that manages a computer's memory resources. It handles memory allocation to processes, protects memory from corruption, translates virtual addresses, and tracks memory usage.
	It examines all memory references on the memory bus, translating these requests, known as virtual memory addresses, into physical addresses in main memory.

- What is IOMMU
	IOMMU, or Input-Output Memory Management Unit, is a hardware component that connects a bus to system memory. It's used to map virtual addresses to physical addresses, which is useful for virtualization. 
	How does IOMMU work?
		Prevents I/O devices from accessing memory outside of the OS's boundaries, allows devices to be assigned directly to a virtual machine.
		Translates device virtual addresses to physical addresses, handles interrupts remapping.

- What is MSI-X
	Message Signaled Interrupts (MSI) are a method of signaling interrupts, using special in-band messages to replace traditional out-of-band signals on dedicated interrupt lines. While message signaled interrupts are more complex to implement in a device, they have some significant advantages over pin-based out-of-band interrupt signalling, such as improved interrupt handling performance. This is in contrast to traditional interrupt mechanisms, such as the legacy interrupt request (IRQ) system.
