HW Interfaces:
	Serial Interface: Serial interface will communicate data one bit at a time(half-duplex or full duplex), utilizing less wires.
		Asynchronous serial interfaces(No clock signal):
			UART(universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter): UART is mostly used as a form of device-to-device hardware communication protocol. UART uses only 	two wires for its transmitting and receiving ends. The buadrate needs to be same on both ends.
			RS-232: 
			RS-485: 

		Synchronous serial interfaces(Clock signal)
			I2C: The I2C(Inter integrated circuit) bus is a two wire serial interface originally developed by the Phillips. The I2C bus uses only two
				bidirectional lines, Serial Data Line (SDA) and a Serial Clock Line (SCL). It follows a master/slave hierarchy, wherein the master is defined as
				the device that clocks the bus, addresses slaves and writes or reads data to and from registers in the slaves. 
			SMBUS: The SMBUS(system management bus) is a subset of I2C developed by Intel. It is a two wire interface used for low speed system management
				communication between devices on a motherboard. The SMBDAT wire transfers serial data, and the SMBCLK wire acts as the serial clock. The master
				drives the SMBCLK, which can range from 10 kHz to 100 kHz, but either line can drive the SMBDAT. Both of these lines are bidirectional.
