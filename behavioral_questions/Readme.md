# SpongeBob_BehavioralPrep

These days(2025), many companies(Amazon, Google, Meta, Nintendo and so on) are focusing on behavioral questions. For the interviewer, the advantage of asking behavioral questions is that they get to know on how you tackle an issue(technical/non-technical) and understand your technical depth on the topic you talk.  

The best way to prepare for behavioral questions is to list down some of the most common questions, think about a time where you experienced this type of situation and write down the story preferably in STAR methodology.   

This folders contains behavioral_questions.txt where i listed down and grouped the most common questions that were asked. Would recommend writing down the scenarios for atleast 10 questions.
